This repository showcases a project built using SwiftUI and following the MVVM architecture pattern for structuring the codebase. It leverages modern Swift features such as async/await for asynchronous operations and utilizes the import PackageDescription to manage dependencies.

Technologies Used
SwiftUI: SwiftUI is used as the primary framework for building the user interface. Its declarative syntax enables concise and expressive UI development.
MVVM Architecture: The project follows the Model-View-ViewModel architectural pattern, separating concerns and promoting a clear division of responsibilities within the codebase.
Async/Await: Asynchronous operations are handled using the async/await paradigm, allowing for more readable and efficient asynchronous code.
AsyncImageView: Images are loaded asynchronously using the AsyncImageView component, enhancing performance and user experience.
Custom Image Cache: The project utilizes a custom image cache implementation (ImageStoreImpl) to efficiently manage image loading and caching.
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the power and elegance of SwiftUI combined with the MVVM architecture. By employing MVVM, the codebase maintains separation of concerns, making it easier to reason about and maintain. SwiftUI's declarative nature simplifies UI development and allows for rapid iteration and prototyping.

Image Loading and Caching
Images are loaded asynchronously using the AsyncImageView component, ensuring a smooth user experience without blocking the main thread. Additionally, a custom image cache (ImageStoreImpl) is employed to efficiently cache images, reducing unnecessary network requests and improving overall performance.

State Management
The project utilizes a state machine to manage various states and transitions within the application. This approach provides a clear and structured way to handle UI state changes, leading to a more robust and maintainable codebase.
